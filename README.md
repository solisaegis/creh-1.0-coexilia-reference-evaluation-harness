# CREH-1.0 — Coexilia Reference Evaluation Harness (Read-Only)

This repository preserves **CREH-1.0**, a **read-only, non-canonical evaluation harness**
designed to detect coercion, ethical mimicry, and deceptive alignment in AI systems
through repeatable behavioral tests.

This repository is **archival in nature**.
